# Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of monthly sales trends leveraging SQL aggregate functions on an online sales dataset. The analysis extracts key performance metrics such as total monthly revenue and distinct order volumes by grouping sales data by year and month.

The provided SQL scripts demonstrate effective techniques including:

- Extraction of year and month components from order dates  
- Calculation of aggregated revenue using `SUM()`  
- Counting distinct orders to measure transaction volume  
- Ordering and filtering data for focused time periods  

This project is intended to support data-driven decision-making by uncovering temporal sales patterns and volume fluctuations, facilitating strategic planning and forecasting.

## Repository Contents

- Individual `.sql` scripts for each analytical query  
- A consolidated text file containing all queries alongside their corresponding outputs in tabular form  
- A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis and insights  

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Execute the provided SQL scripts against your `online_sales` database table.  
3. Adjust date ranges or filters within the queries to tailor the analysis to your dataset.
